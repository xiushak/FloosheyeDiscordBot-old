# FlooshedEyed

A program to apply the fisheye effect on images. There is currently 3 versions of the effect.

The first version, EllipseFishEyeModel, maps the image onto an ellipse. This one does not allow you to change where the
fisheye effects centers at. An example of this version working on the grid image above is shown below.

The second version, FishEyeModel, allows you to move the center of the fisheyeEffect. Below is an example of the version

This one is an example where the effect was moved to the top left quadrant of the image

To use the FacialRecognitionFishEyeModel, you need to download OpenCV. I used opencv-453 in this implementation. Below
is an example using my face.
